### <i> We will be using GitHub classroom for this assignment.  You should submit your assignment before the deadline by pushing your final Vivado, SDK, and Android Studio (if combined ECE 544/558 project) projects and other deliverables to your team's shared GitHub repository for the assignment. We'd also like you to archive your final submission repository as a .zip or  file and upload it to your Final Project Deliverables dropbox on D2L.  We realize that this may not work for all teams due to the upload file size limitation in D2L</i>

## After completing this assignment students should have:
- Proposed and executed a team-based SoC-based embedded system project
- Prepared and presented a progress report to members of the class and others
- Completed a technical presentation and demonstration of the project
- Gained experience in participating in team-based project development and management for a "significant" project
- (optional) Completed a project that also includes an Android app  (combined ECE 544/558 projects)

### Summary

This final project is a chance to put what you learned this term into practice.  Each team will propose a final project which must be accepted by the instructor.  Proposals are due to D2L by 10:00 PM on Sun, 19-May. Once the project has been accepted the team will complete the design of the project, implement and debug it, and show it off to their classmates, the instructor and T/A and, perhaps, a few invited guests.  Your team project will be in a friendly competition with the other project teams, with the oft-coveted "Wall of Fame" award going to the best overall project (design, documentation, presentation, etc.).  There is no cash award to the Wall of Fame winners, no bling, no s.w.a.g. ["stuff we all get" according to the Urban Dictionary (https://www.urbandictionary.com)].  So why bother...bragging rights!  Impress your friends!  Impress your classmates!  Impress the hiring managers!

We will be using the Group Project support in GitHub classroom for this assignment.  This means that your team will share a private repository on GitHub that can also be accessed by the instructor and T/A for the course. You will submit your work via that repository.  We will review your work and provide feedback based on what your final submission was.  The process for accepting this assignment is the same as that used for Project #2. If you are in a new team one of the team members should create a new group and tell his/her partners what group to join.  As with Project #2 please join only your team;  joining another team either accidentally or deliberately could prevent the actual team member(s) to join.

### Where to submit your deliverables for the project:
- Project Proposal:  Submit to your Final Project Proposal dropbox on D2L.  Include a .pdf of your approved proposal in your deliverables
- Progress Report slides:  Include a .pdf of your progress report presentation in your deliverables
- Demo presentation slides - Include  a .pdf of your final project presentation in your GitHub submission.
- Design Report:  Include a .pdf of your final project design report in your GitHub submission
- Source code, etc.: Include your Vivado, SDK, and Android Studio project(s) and any other source code, transcripts, etc. in your GitHub submission.  For ECE 544/558 projects your source code will also include Java or Kotlin source code for any Android apps they implement for the project.
- (optional) Video(s) of your demo.  You are welcome to include any videos you feel will aid in grading your project in your GitHub repository
- Final GitHub repository - to GitHub...obviously, but I'd also like you to upload a .zip file of your repository to your Final Project Deliverables dropbox on D2L.  Some of you will  not be able to do so because D2L places a size limit on uploads.  Still,  I'd appreciate it if you could give it a try.  It's not a big deal either way, but it just might make our grading more efficient.
